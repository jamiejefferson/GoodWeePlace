            Being a "Good Wee Place" means committing to creating a safe, welcoming environment for 
            trans and genderqueer people. When you display the Good Wee Place sticker, you're making 
            a public commitment to:

          <ul className="list-content">
            <li className="list-item-content">
              <strong>Respect everyone's identity:</strong> Use the names and pronouns people ask you to use, 
              without question or debate.
            </li>
            <li className="list-item-content">
              <strong>Challenge discrimination:</strong> Speak up when you witness transphobia or 
              gender-based discrimination in your space.
            </li>
            <li className="list-item-content">
              <strong>Provide safe facilities:</strong> Ensure your restrooms and facilities are accessible 
              and safe for all genders.
            </li>
            <li className="list-item-content">
              <strong>Educate your team:</strong> Train staff on how to be respectful and supportive of 
              trans and genderqueer customers and colleagues.
            </li>
            <li className="list-item-content">
              <strong>Listen and learn:</strong> Be open to feedback and willing to improve your practices 
              to better serve the community.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-body-large">
            Displaying the sticker is just the beginning. It's a visible commitment to ongoing action 
            and support for trans and genderqueer people in your community.
          </p>
          <p className="text-body-large">
