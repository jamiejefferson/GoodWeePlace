        <h1>Good Wee Place: Glasgow's trans community reclaims the right to exist in public</h1>
        <p className="text-body-large" style={{ marginTop: '1rem', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
          A new grassroots initiative is mapping venues where trans and genderqueer people are welcome, because we refuse to be legislated out of public life.

            <strong>Glasgow, 16th January, 2026</strong> — Good Wee Place is a community-led project created by trans people, for trans and gender non-conforming people. It launches in response to an increasingly hostile environment where our right to simply exist in public spaces is being questioned, debated, and undermined.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-body-large">
            Recent months have seen a UK Supreme Court ruling weaponised against us, misleading EHRC guidance designed to exclude us, and relentless media coverage that treats our lives as a culture war talking point. The message is clear: we are not welcome.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-body-large" style={{ fontWeight: 'var(--font-weight-bold)' }}>
            We disagree.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-body-large">
            Good Wee Place invites venues to publicly declare that trans and genderqueer people are welcome in their space. No questions, no challenges, no debate about which toilet we're allowed to use. Participating venues display a window sticker and appear on our online map, creating a growing network of places where our community can go out, grab a drink, meet friends, and live normal lives without fear. We're starting in Glasgow, but we'd love to see this spread to cities across the UK and beyond.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-body-large">
            We are refusing to accept a world where using a public bathroom requires courage. We are building the infrastructure of our own safety when institutions won't protect us. And we are showing that while politicians and newspapers may have abandoned us, our city hasn't.

              "They want us to disappear. To stay home. To stop being visible. Good Wee Place is our answer to that. We're not going anywhere, and neither are the venues, businesses, and communities who stand with us. Glasgow has always been a city that looks after its own. This is us looking after each other."
